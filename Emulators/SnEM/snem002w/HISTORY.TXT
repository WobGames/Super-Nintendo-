2/08/02 - Started work.
           This is my 6th (!) attempt at a SNES emulator, the last one got
           some games starting but was _VERY_ slow. With this one I'm using
           a different method of opcode fetching and executing that should be
           faster.
03/08/02 - Enough opcodes implemented to run sonic.smc now. Video emulation
           added and optimized, one layer of mode 1. Currently running at 3x
           SNES speed on 350mhz (somewhat faster than my previous attempts).
           Update (at 12:15) -
           More opcodes, meaning more demos run. Second layer of mode 1 added
           (using uber-fast masking technique), now about 2.5x SNES speed.
04/08/02 - Modes 0+7 (no rotozoom though) added. More opcodes as well -
           Sneswish starts, and First Drop runs. Nesquik's scroller is broken
           though, and ATX Xmas demo looks buggered - the muzak code is
           accessed through a JSR, and it rewrites all of RAM and the stack
           pointer, then RTSes. I don't see how this is supposed to work...
05/08/02 - Fixed a big bug in op B1 (LDA (),y) - Nesquik scroller works now
           (along with most of the demo). Fixed scrolling direction - before
           Nesquik it was impossible to tell if it was in the right direction
           or not.
           Listened to Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood today for a laugh,
           it's a dreadful tune.
06/08/02 - Fixed stack access, RTS Pac-man now works. Added BG3 in mode 1, but
           it's slightly bugged. Sprites added (early - 16x16 only), Pac-man
           playable!
07/08/02 - More opcodes. Got KSFH to go through main menu and to intro, but is
           bugged - the rats walk round for ever and krusty never comes on
           stage...
08/08/02 - Yet more opcodes. FF2 displays title now (but hangs there).
12/08/02 - Fixed ATX Xmas problem - I never knew that some addressing modes
           can access the next bank - I thought they all wrapped.
20/08/02 - Started work on SPC700 (for no reason...)
23/08/02 - SPC700 now works with some demos (no DSP emulation yet though),
           however it hangs KSFH for some reason. I need an SPC disassembler...
24/08/02 - Fixed FF2 problem - pad 2,3 and 4 registers can't return $FF (as I
           have been making unimplemented registers do), otherwise the game
           thinks all buttons are pressed...
           (later on)
           Added tons of opcodes for FF2, now it starts the intro, but sprites
           are missing and it hangs after fading out from map...
25/08/02 - Fixed a couple of 65816 bugs, ATX-DEM1.SMC starts. Palette now
           emulated. Attempted to slow down using vsync, but this just makes
           it drop 20fps, not drop to the refresh rate...
	   (later on)
	   Got Mario World to...start. The entire level data is missing from
	   VRAM, so no collision detection works and everything bollockses up.
26/08/02 - Attempted to track down Mario World bug, failed.
           Added some BCD, Columns now kinda works.
           FF2 now draws map during intro.
           Revamped sprite support, KSFH intro looks okay now (Krusty stops at
           the middle of the screen in mid step though :)
           (later on - again)
           KSFH is now playable! (just). Krusty has difficulty jumping very
           high though, and the second sprite table isn't set up, so added a
           hack to fix 16x16 sprites.

28/08/02 - HDMA processing added.
02/09/02 - Started mode 7 rotozoom, not correct yet
04/09/02 - Added vline counter for Legend of the Mystical Ninja, still doesn't
           work.
05/09/02 - Added some more opcode to get Super Soccer up and running. Runs
           demo mode fine (except for mode 7 bugs), but can't start game (skips
           to demo instead).
06/09/02 - Fixed stupid bug in INC abs, loads of games work better. Added the
           BCD.
07/09/02 - Fixed the BCD. Made ADC+SBC modular, for less inconsistencies.
           Added a couple more SPC opcodes. Some debugging reveals that the
           KSFH SPC lockup is a 65816 bug, not an SPC700 bug. Added toggles
           for BGs.

13/09/02 - Added more opcodes, mainly for Gradius 3 (playable!).
14/09/02 - Fixed sprite size bug, was combination of bad drawing code and
           incorrect docs. Added couple of opcodes for Super Off-road, still
           unplayable though. Fixed CMP [],y - DWARF.SMC now works fine (about
           fucking time).

30/09/02 - TRAC/SNEeSe sent me some corrected SPC docs, might help the core.
           Ran a few more games on the emu - dbz1e.smc is worth mentioning, as
           the main guy on the intro spins round and round ad infinitum. Quite
           amusing, but might also help with debugging. Addams Family is also
           bugged, all the screen data (titles+levels) is squashed.
01/12/02 - Wrote quick test program for ADC/SBC, SBC flags now fixed. 
           Fixed matrix 16x8 multiply results, Super Off-road now OK.
02/12/02 - Couple of 65816 fixes. Nothing major or significant.

21/12/02 - Started rewrite of 65816 core.
19/01/03 - Fixed bug in TYX, KSFH works again. Fixed up some PPU access,
           Mario 1 + 2 in Mario Allstars work now. Sprites now smooth
           horizontally (backgrounds still jerk though).
29/01/03 - Fixed BG masking. Fixed sprite positioning. A couple more opcodes
           added.
08/02/03 - Fixed bug in BIT - TMNT4 works properly again. Fixed some stuff for
           Humans. IRQs now on by default. Centred screen.
09/02/03 - Fixed PAL/NTSC detection (hopefully)

11/03/03 - Got some ADC/SBC fixes from TRAC. Added 64x64 mode. Mario World is
	   now (kind-of) playable.
12/03/03 - Got some more ADC/SBC fixes, plus a BIT fix, from TRAC.
13/03/03 - Squashed some addressing mode bugs. Fixed 64x64 mode so it works.
05/04/03 - Started work on new graphics engine.
06/04/03 - Mode 1 now OK in new graphics engine. Full smooth scrolling +
           sprites + priorites + HDMA (in theory).
12/04/03 - Realised that mid-screen mode changes are impossible with current
           engine, so started some rewriting.
16/04/03 - All modes (hopefully) supported.
21/04/03 - Improved mode 7 a bit.
01/05/03 - Tracked down problem with some Ocean games (Addams Family, Robocod
           and Pushover at least) - added 16x16 tile mode. Pushover now OK,
           Addams Family buggered a bit though.
           Interesting bit of info - setting every even byte of RAM to &20
           makes Soccer Kid go into some kind of debug mode.
           Added HDMA toggle. Soccer Kid totally fails to scroll with HDMA off.
22/05/03 - Fixed addressing bug in JML[].
24/05/03 - Fixed bug in DMA. Fixed bug in $2104.
29/06/03 - Fixed slowdown bug in some games. Fixed Allstars a bit - bad initial
           sprites. Also fixed 8 bitplane modes.
